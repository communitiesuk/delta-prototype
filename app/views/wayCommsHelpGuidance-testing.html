    <!-- <p class="govuk-body-l">As part of the improvements to Delta we have introduced new pages for:</p> -->
    <p class="govuk-body-l">We are using your feedback to improve Delta. This will make it easier to find things, faster to use and simpler to understand. The first part of these improvements are new pages that show data providers and certifiers exactly what they need to do.
They are:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-body-l">
      <li><a href="#homepage">homepage</a></li>
      <li><a href="#collectionGroup">collection group</a></li>
      <li><a href="#collection">collection</a></li>
      <li><a href="#record">record</a></li>

<section id="homepage" class="govuk-!-static-margin-bottom-9">
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Homepage</h2>
  <div class="govuk-grid-row">
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
      <p>The new homepage shows:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>open and missed collections</li>
          <li>records that need certifying</li>
          <li>records that have been submitted</li>
          <li>deadlines</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This makes it easier to get to collections.</p>
      <p>Users can see information for all their organisations and will no longer have to choose which organisation to view.</p>
      <p>Links to support are clearer, making it easier for users to find the support they need.</p>

        <img src="/public/images/grab-landing-banner.png" class="delta-image-responsive govuk-!-width-three-quarters"> 
        <p>A banner at the top of the page shows users actions they need to take. This could be a record that needs submitting or certifying, or a collection where the deadline has passed. It links to the section of the page with more information.</p>
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Open collections</h3>
      <p>The homepage shows open collections for every organisation the user has access to where:</p>

      <!-- <p>The homepage shows up to 5 records. It links to the collections table which shows all the records.</p> -->
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Missed collections</h3>
      <p>The homepage shows collections with no returns in the last 2 years.</p>
  
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Records requiring certification</h3>
      <!-- <p>Data certifiers and users with the correct permissions can see which records they need to certify.</p> -->
      <p>The homepage displays up to 5 records needing certification from various organisations and collections. Users can select the 'view record and certify' link for more details and to certify the record.</p>
