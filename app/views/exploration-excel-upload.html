      Improving Excel upload experience

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Hypothesis</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The current method for uploading data via Excel provides such a poor user experience that data providers rarely choose it as their preferred submission method. Instead, they often opt for the more time-consuming, form-based submission process.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Why is the Excel upload experience so poor?</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The Excel template—especially when auto-generated by Orbeon—is confusing and difficult to use.</li>
          <li>Inline validation rules within the template are either inconsistent or entirely absent. This allows incorrect data to be entered, which ultimately results in the upload being rejected.</li>
          <li>There is no meaningful error or validation feedback during the upload process. Users receive no clear indication of what went wrong or how to correct it.</li>
          <li>In many cases, data providers would prefer to submit via Excel, as they already prepare their data outside Delta in Excel.</li>
          <li>For more complex data collections, providers find Excel easier to work with because it displays all required fields and guidance in one view. This enables them to input data in any order, without being forced to follow a linear submission path.</li>
          <li>Excel can be a far more efficient method for submitting multi-record returns, especially when large volumes of data are involved.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Suggested next steps</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>
            Use the Collections MI Report to analyse:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>What percentage of collections currently offer Excel as a method of data submission?</li>
              <li>Of those that do, what percentage of returns are actually submitted via Excel?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Conduct heuristic evaluations of all Excel templates—whether auto-generated by Orbeon or manually created by collections managers. Assess their accessibility and usability, and evaluate the clarity of guidance provided, as well as the presence and consistency of inline validation rules.
          </li>
          <li>Interview data providers and collections managers who make use of Excel uploads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Reality check</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Significantly improving the user experience of submitting data to Delta via Excel upload will only be achievable if:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Excel templates can be (and are) designed to be accessible, intuitive, and aligned with Orbeon's validation rules. The validation logic must be fully mirrored in the Excel template to prevent avoidable rejections.</li>
          <li>The current validation feedback in Orbeon is completely overhauled. A redesigned report must clearly indicate where errors exist and provide actionable guidance for correcting them. However, as the validation functionality resides within Orbeon, it may lie outside the immediate control of the development team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Stretch goal</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Julius and Steve attended a presentation at Service Week 2025 showcasing a flexible approach to importing data via Excel. A key highlight was the system's ability to accept data in various formats from different users, intelligently identify the structure, and normalise it into a consistent internal format. Exploring a similar approach for Delta could significantly enhance flexibility and adoption.

        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">A thousand things at once</h1>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          The following is based on <a href="https://www.register-dynamics.co.uk">Register Dynamics</a>' excellent session <strong>A Thousand Things at Once: Bulk Transactions and Data Collection in Digital Services</strong>, delivered as part of Services Week 2025.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          It aligns with the ambition to improve the user journey for bulk uploads for Delta — specifically through Excel — while supporting the GDS goals of building services for everyone and ensuring they accommodate the needs of all users.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What are bulk transactions?</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Typical government services deliver single transactions, such as applying for a driving licence. Bulk transactions involve users interacting with the service once but processing multiple transactions — like registering 1,000 MOTs.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Design patterns for bulk transactions</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          The Home Office design system includes an <a href="https://design-system.homeoffice.gov.uk/patterns/add-multiple-things/" class="govuk-link">"Add multiple things"</a> pattern. This works well for small volumes but doesn't scale for large numbers.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          APIs are effective for high-volume transactions but often present a capability barrier for non-programmers. Spreadsheets have emerged as a crucial tool for users without technical skills, allowing for structured data management and transfer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Challenges with spreadsheets</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Users struggle to understand and fill out templates correctly.</li>
          <li><strong>Transformation:</strong> Users must reformat existing data to meet rigid service requirements, often needing technical knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Real-world spreadsheets often contain titles, blank rows, and multiple tables, complicating upload processes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Improving spreadsheet services</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Point 4 of the Service Standard requires services to be simple to use — and that includes spreadsheet templates.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          If you're going to use a spreadsheet upload in your service, there are several design accommodations you can make to improve the experience for users:
        </p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Enhance templates with clear guidance, optional fields, and personalised formats</li>
          <li>Support files with multiple sheets and complex structures</li>
          <li>Assist users with transforming data into the right format</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">
          Services should be flexible with the data structure they accept, rather than requiring users to adapt to rigid formats. This prioritises user needs over government requirements, making services simpler and more accessible.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data Upload Design Kit</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Register Dynamics' <strong><a href="https://register-dynamics.github.io/data-import/">Data Upload Design Kit</a></strong> is an open-source tool for designing better spreadsheet services. It helps build flexible, human-friendly solutions for bulk transactions across government services.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          There's a clear need for better spreadsheet services that meet government design standards. The Data Upload Design Kit represents a step forward in making bulk uploads simpler, clearer and more effective.
        </p>
