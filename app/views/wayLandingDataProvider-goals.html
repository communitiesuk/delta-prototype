        <p>'The platform is not easy to navigate, as I use it infrequently to certify claims I can forget where the claims are on the platform. It would help if there was a clear link on the home page to 'certify claims'.</p>
        <p>â€” User research response, April 2024</p>
        <p>The above is relevant to data providers too</p>

        <li>Better UX for Data Providers</li>
        <li>Faster; one-click access to the things they need to work on (open collections)</li>
        <li>Error reduction: easier routes to checking data (omissions and accuracy)</li>
        <li>Reduced missed deadline</li>
        <li>Remove need (and confusion) to use Collections Dashboard and the Data Store</li>
        <li>Implement consistent user-centred naming conventions (Collections > Submission > Record(s))</li>
